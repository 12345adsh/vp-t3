                            <p class="p_modal" style="color: blueviolet">Drug information is something that is needed by all pharma professionals whether in practice, industry, pharmacy education or regulatory. Drug information in this title has been compiled based on their use in disorders of different body systems like gastro-intestinal tract (GIT), respiratory tract, cardio-vascular system. In the introductory section of each part, there is general discussion on different classes of drugs, which are used in the treatment of disorders of the system. Later, there is drug information on individual drugs. There are two chapters, which are not specific to system but deal with common factor, for example pain. These chapters include drugs used in pain, fever, and inflammation and anti-infective drugs. The book has been divided into eight parts. Many pharma professionals may not be conversant with medical terms, therefore, abbreviations and glossary of medical terms have been given in the beginning of the book. There are three appendices in the book. Appendix I contains the list of drugs and their FDC, manufacture and sale of which have been banned in India. Appendix II contains list of schedule X drugs for which separate licence is required for manufacture and sale. Appendix III contains list of medical devices, which have been notified as drugs by Govt. of India<br>

US FDA had observed in some cases that studies submitted in support of safety of regulated products had not been conducted in acceptable manner. In view of this, GLP guidelines were incorporated under the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR 58) in late seventies. Based on these guidelines a group of countries known as Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) developed GLP in early eighties. In India, GLP were incorporated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules as Schedule L1 in 2008 to be effective after two years. The former GLPs have been revised a couple of times. The first edition of this book was published in 2000 when no national GLP guidelines were available and discussion was mainly based on US FDA GLP. In view of the changes and appearance of GLP under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, third edition of the book has been published. Besides Indian GLP, US FDA GLP and principles of OECD GLP, associated topics like inspection, sampling, statistical quality control (SQC), analytical method validation, laboratory safety, NABL accreditation, GLP certification under OECD GLP Program have been included in the book to make it useful to the pharmaceutical industry and pharmacy educational institutions.

                            <p class="p_modal" style="color: blueviolet; text-align: left;">Validation is a process of establishing documentary evidence demonstrating that a procedure, process, or activity carried out in production or testing maintains the desired level of compliance at all stages. In Pharma Industry it is very important apart from final testing and compliance of product with standard that the process adapted to produce itself must assure that process will consistently produce the expected results. Here the desired results are established in terms of specifications for outcome of the process. Qualification of systems and equipment is therefore a part of process of validation. It is a requirement of food and drug, pharmaceutical regulating agencies like FDA's good manufacturing practices guidelines.<br>

                            <p class="p_modal" style="color: blueviolet; text-align: left;">The purpose of stability testing is to provide evidence on how the quality of an active pharmaceutical ingredient or medicinal product varies with time under the influence of a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light, and to establish a re-test period for the active pharmaceutical ingredient or a shelf life for the medicinal product and recommended storage conditions. The design of the stability-testing programme should take into account the intended market and the climatic conditions in the area in which the medicinal products will be used. The stability testing recommendations in this guideline cover the long-term storage condition for all Climatic Zones, i.e. I – IV. The shelf life should be established with due regard to the climatic zone(s) in which the products are to be marketed. For certain preparations, the shelf-life can be guaranteed only if specific storage instructions are complied with.<br>
